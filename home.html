        and web development.
        I am passionate about creating intuitive and visually appealing digital experiences that solve real-world
        problems.

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I pursued my academic journey at <strong>Kelden University</strong>, where I successfully obtained both my
        Ordinary Level and Advanced Level qualifications in Software Engineering.

        My education provided a strong foundation in core areas like computer programming, software development, user
        interface design, data structures, and computer systems. It also encouraged independent thinking and team-based
        project work, which continue to shape how I approach real-world problems in technology today.

      <h2>Professional Interest</h2>
      <p>
        I am deeply passionate about the intersection of design, technology, and user experience. My core interests lie
        in creating intuitive, elegant, and functional interfaces that solve real-world problems.

        I enjoy working on full-stack web development projects, especially those that focus on impactful digital
        solutions such as portfolio websites, e-commerce platforms, and systems for local businesses.

        I'm also enthusiastic about mobile application development, system automation, and exploring how artificial
        intelligence can be integrated into everyday tools to improve efficiency.

        Beyond development, I take interest in product design, brand identity, and digital marketing strategies. I
        continuously seek to bridge the gap between visual creativity and technical implementation.
